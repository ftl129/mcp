## üîç Description

This project provides a fast and scalable exact algorithm for solving the Maximum Clique Problem (MCP) in large sparse networks. It introduces a novel decomposition approach based on Complete-Upper-Bound-Induced Subgraphs (CUBIS), allowing significant pruning of the original graph.

The algorithm performs two main steps:
1. Constructs the first CUBIS from the top core layers to search for a candidate maximum clique.
2. Optionally constructs a second CUBIS if necessary to refine the result.

Experiments on 50 real-world networks (up to 20 million nodes) demonstrate near-linear time complexity.

## üöÄ Usage

1. Modify `NetworkAddress` in the script to point to your input edge list.
2. Set `LayerNum` to define how many top core layers to use in the first decomposition step.
3. Run:
